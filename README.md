An interactive Jupyter Notebook that provides a visual guide to the classic Iris flower classification problem, featuring detailed data exploration, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, and a live prediction that identifies a flower's species with an image.

## ✨ Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire workflow of a data science project. The primary focus is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that reveal the underlying structure of the data.

After a thorough visual analysis, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn to classify the flower species. The project culminates in an interactive prediction cell where you can input custom flower measurements and see the model predict the species in real-time.

### 🚀 Live Prediction Demo

The final output of the notebook allows you to input custom measurements and receive a classification, complete with an image of the predicted flower.


> **Note:** To create this image, run the final cell in your notebook, take a screenshot of the output (showing the input, the text prediction, and the flower image), save it as `demo.png`, and add it to your repository.

## 🚀 How to Use

There are two ways to run this project: using Google Colab (recommended) or on your local machine.

### 1. Using Google Colab (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is by using Google Colab, which provides a free, cloud-based notebook environment.

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME]/blob/main/iris_flower_classification.ipynb)

> **Instructions:**
> 1.  Replace `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_REPO_NAME]` in the link above with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
> 2.  Click the "Open in Colab" button to launch the notebook.
> 3.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

### 2. Running on a Local Machine

To run this project locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git
    cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow jupyterlab
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your browser where you can open and run the `.ipynb` file.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

A major focus of this project is to understand the data through visualizations before modeling.

### Pair Plot Analysis
The pair plot instantly reveals that the **Setosa** species is linearly separable from the other two based on petal measurements. **Versicolor** and **Virginica** show some overlap but are still largely distinct.


> **Note:** Save the pair plot generated by your notebook as `pair_plot.png` and add it to your repository.

### Model Performance: Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows a perfect score on the test set, with the model correctly classifying all 30 unseen samples. This confirms the high degree of separability we observed in the EDA phase.


> **Note:** Save the confusion matrix generated by your notebook as `confusion_matrix.png` and add it to your repository.

## 📈 Results

The K-Nearest Neighbors model performed exceptionally well, achieving **100% accuracy** on the test set. This outstanding performance is a direct result of the clear, distinct clusters of data points for each species, which we identified during our visual analysis.
